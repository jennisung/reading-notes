## Code 401 - Advanced Software Development

## Overview of reading notes

These readings just focused on the paradigm of purely function programming.

### Can you change the state of a data structure using functional programming?

No, in purely functional programming, data structures are persistent.

### Define purely functional programming.

**Purely functional programming:** is a programming paradigm, that views all computations as the evaluation of mathematical function.

### How do you think purely functional programming will differ from the programs youâ€™ve written so far in this course?

Since purely functional programming, data cannot be altered after creation, it may lead us to have a different mindset in approaching problems.

## Things I want to know more about

* just general stuff about each of these concepts. No real questions.
