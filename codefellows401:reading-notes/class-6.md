# Reading Notes


## Code 401 - Advanced Software Development

## Overview of reading notes

These readings more into the difference between class and objects. In addition to understand static methods or other static keywords. Lastly, we also learned about singleton and design pattern.


## What is the difference between an Object and a Class in Java?

Objects represent concepts to model real-world objects, whereas class is more of a blueprint that defines structure/behavior. Another difference is that objects have a bundle of state and behavior, whereas class is prototype form which objects are created.

## Explain to a non-technical friend the concept of inheritance in Java.

Inheritance in Java allows you to create new classes that inherit "behaviors" from that classes. Thus, making it easier to organize and structure your software.

## Static methods are also called what? Why?

Static methods are called class methods because they belong to the class itself, not to the specific objects. We can use the class name to invoke static methods.

## How can you access a variable of a class without instantiating an object from that class?

If you want to access a variable of a class without instantiating an object from that class, by declaring the variable as static.

## What is a Design Pattern? Describe one or two with analogies from your previous work experience.

A design pattern ensures that a class only as one instance, while allowing for global access to this instance.

**Examples*
1.
2.

## What is a Singleton?

A Singleton is a design pattern that makes sure to restrict a class to one object. 

## Things I want to know more about

* just general stuff about each of these concepts. No real questions.
