# Reading Notes


## Code 401 - Advanced Software Development

## Overview of reading notes

These readings delve more into various concepts in java such as int/integers and scanners.

## Explain the difference between an “int” and an “Integer” in Java.

* **int**:

1. Data: is a primitive data type.
2. Memory: 32 bits of memory

* **integer** 

1. Data: is a wrapper class, that wraps the "int" primitive type.
2. Memory: 128 bits

## What is the default value for ints? Integers?

The default value for ints is 0, as it is primitive type. Whereas, the default value for integers is "null", as it is a wrapper class.

## What is autoboxing? Unboxing?

Autoboxing is refers to process of converting between the primitive type to a reference type (wrapper class). Unboxing is the opposite, it converts reference type of primitive type.

## List the three basic categories of exceptions.

**Three categories of exceptions**

1. Checked Exception
2. Unchecked Exceptions/runtime exception
3. Errors

## What type of statement can you use to handle an exception?

The type of statement you can use is the try-catch statement to handle exceptions.

## Describe a situation where you think it would be useful to have a program that scans text.

A situation where you think it would be useful to have a program that scans text is Translating Language, basically translating text from one language to another. 

## What is input from a Scanner broken down into?

Input from a scanner is broken down into individual tokens.

## Things I want to know more about

* I'm still confused about bits/memory in terms of ints and integers. Why is it important?
