### Describe asynchronous actions in your own words.

Asynchronous actions means that your application is performing tasks independently from the main program. To further explain this, basically, the program is continuing operate, while also handle additional tasks while other tasks are running in the background.

### What is the benefit of asynchronous methods?

Asynchronous methods help make programs work smoother and faster. This is beneficial when you're dealing with multiple task at once.
