## Overview of reading notes

These readings delve into basic conepts in java, such as the various types of loops in java, as well as arrays. In addition on how to use various tools in java programming.

## Use an analogy to explain Built-In packages. Give examples.

One example of an analogy to explain Built-in apps/features built-in features that comes included with a new iphone/smartphone. These features/apps are ready to use, which provide users with various functionality to perform various tasks.
