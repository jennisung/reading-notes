# Reading Notes


## Code 401 - Advanced Software Development

## Overview of reading notes

The readings delve into Android app development, the app components, and resources.

### What is a technology youâ€™ve used before that is similar to Shared Preferences?

An example of a technology that is similar to shared preferece that I've used before is probably localstorage. Local storage stores data in the browser, and persist even  if the users closes the browser. This information can be re-accessed after closing a application.

### Why is testing important? Give at least 4 reasons, and explain which is the most important to you and why.

Four reasons why testing is important to verify your app is doing what it's suppose to be doing as intended, maintain code and refactor code if needed, detect/prevent any bugs in your code, and improve user experience by making sure your app/components are working seamlessly.

Of these 4 reasons, I believe testing for bugs is the most important. Bugs can make your application un-useable, and introducting a application with bugs to users, can be a big security risk. So I would say testing regularly for any bugs in your code is most important.

### Create an analogy for Tasks and the back stack. Have we used a similar system before? Explain.

An analogy for tasks and the back stack is imagine you have a to-do list. Each item you add to the to-do list can be compared to the back stack. The first task on your to-do list would typically be the one at the top, and when you revisit tasks, you're essentially going back to previous items on the list.

The reading provided an example involving emails. When you select an unopened email, that email opens, it is added to the back stack. Each time the user selects an email to open it is sent to the backstack. When you click "back" the activity is complete and poppers off the stack.


## Things I want to know more about

* just general stuff about each of these concepts. No real questions.
