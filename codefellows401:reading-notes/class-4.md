# Reading Notes


## Code 401 - Advanced Software Development

## Overview of reading notes

The readings for today go over concepts such the differences between objects and classes. In addition, to concepts stuch as converting between decimal, hexadecimal, binary numbers.

## Explain the difference between an object and a class.

Objects represent concepts to model real-world objects, whereas class is more of a blueprint that defines structure/behavior. Another difference is that objects have a bundle of state and behavior, whereas class is prototype form which objects are created.

## Name two types of state that a Student object might have.

Two types of state that a student object may have is maybe their student ID and Grade. Both of which is unique to each student.

## Name two types of behaviours that a student object might have.

Two types of behavior that a student object might have is their engagement to study or behavior to enroll in certain courses.

## Explain the significance of a constructor for a class.

The significance of a constructor is that it initializes an object's state, allows customization during creation, and makes sure there is proper encapsulation and initialization.

## Write the declaration statement for a class named “Student” (do not fill it with fields and methods).

`public class Student {
    // Add methods/fields for student class
}`

## What is the value of the binary number 1101?

The decimal value 13. (?)

## Write the number 52 in binary. Write it in hexidecimal.

110100

## Things I want to know more about

* why are we learning about "decimal, hexadecimal, binary numbers." in terms of coding?
