## Code 401 - Advanced Software Development: Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview of reading notes

These videos and articles provide an overview of concepts in Data Structures and Algorithms. They are important resources as they cover various concepts, including the pros and cons of differvarious problem-solving approaches in data structures and algorithms, Big O notation, and recursion. By exploring these materials, I can gain a better understanding of how to analyze leetcode style problems, and choose appropriate best data structures to solve problems.

## What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

In the "DATA STRUCTURES you MUST know (as a Software Developer)" video details several important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem. For example, the presenter goes over the pros and cons for; linked-list, arrays, hash tables, stack queue, and graph trees. One of the more important things you should consider when deciding data structure, that the presenter mentions is consider is efficiency or the "Big O" notation associated with the data structure's operations.


## How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

 In the "Recursion in software development" video (4:25 - 5:12), the base case and recursive case in recursion is discussed. The base case serves as a condition that prevent the function from calling itself in repeatedly. It acts as a break point for the recursion. Thus, to ensure that one avoids resursive call stack, define the base case for your function.

* I'm still confused on the big-O?
