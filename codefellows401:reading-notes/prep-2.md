## Code 401 - Advanced Software Development: Practice in the Terminal

## Summary

Going over the various terminal commands was a good refresher. When I was first introduced to the terminal, it felt intimidating. However, after completing Code 201 and 301, some of the commands now feel like second nature to me. Rereading these commands made me realize that I haven't been utilizing the full potential and usefulness of the terminal. Among the readings on the website, I found the file manipulation section to be the most helpful, and I came across some commands that I can see myself using frequently. For example, instead of manually creating new files or copying files/directories, I can utilize the terminal for these tasks. One "ah hah" moment I had when reviewing the website was when I was reviewing the cheat sheet. I didn't realize "~" (tilde) or  "." /".." (dot dot) typically reference something, for example, the tilder represent paths, and the two-dot reference the current directory. Another useful thing I learned from the readings was the "man" command, which provides information on the commands available on my system. I hadn't realized that this command was available and could provide such valuable reference.
