## Overview of reading notes

These readings delve into authentication methods, such as social login using OAuth 2.0.

### In non-technical terms, describe what using OAuth can provide for your application.

OAuth simply allows programmers to implement secure authentication. It is popular because there is no danger of leaking sensitive information since it does not handle user login credentials, such as usernames or passwords. This makes it a convenient way to log in. Users can use other applications to log in, like their Google account or GitHub account.

### Which authentication providers are covered in the tutorial?

**The tutorial covers two authentication providers:**

1. GitHub: Users can log in to the application using their GitHub credentials.

2. Google: Users can also log in to the application using their Google credentials. The application gets the required permissions from the user's Google account.
