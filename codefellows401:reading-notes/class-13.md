## Overview of reading notes

The readings delved into testing using Spring and Spring Data REST.

### Name a few real life examples of “One To Many” relatioships.

A few real life example of a "One to Many" relationship is; a relationship between the "Library" entity and the "Book" entity, or "customers" and "orders" or "teachers" and "students".

### Given two entities, one named Player and one named Team, if you wanted to create a one to many relationship with those entities which would be the one and which would be the many?

Given two entities, and in the relationship between Player and Team. The Team entity represents one thing, while the Player entity represents the "many" things. While each team can have many players, each player can only belong to one team.

### Explain one to many relationships to a non-technical friend.

In a one-to-many relationship, lets say there is group A and B. Group A can have various/multiple connections with various things from Group B. But, each thing in Group B can only have one connection with a thing from Group A.

### Describe the difference between a unit test and an integration test.

A unit test is testing individual units of code in isolation. Whereas, integration testing makes sure that the interactions between various components of an app works together in a real-world test case scenario.

### What is the object that provides support for Sprin MVC Testing?

The object that provides support for Spring MVC Testing is the MockMvc class.

### What does the “perform()” method do in a Spring integration test?

The perform() initiates the GET request and provides access to the response for testing in Spring integration tests.
