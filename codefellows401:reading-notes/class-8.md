# Reading Notes


## Code 401 - Advanced Software Development

## Overview of reading notes

These readings discuss MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and emphasize the importance of the Rule of Three concept or avoiding code repetition.

## Are there any projects that youâ€™ve built during your time at Code Fellows (or prior) which could benefit from applying the Rule of Three to DRY up your code?

The only project I would think of that we did in code fellows that can benefit from appplying the rule od three is maybe the Cookie-Stand project we did, where we had to create multiple functions doing the same thing. In the Cookie-Stand project, we implemented multiple functions that perform similar calculations or operations on the cookie sales data. For example, to calculate the average daily sales, the total sales for a given timeframe, and the peak sales hour. To help dry up our code, we can create one function that encapsulates the common calculations, likes a sales calculator.


## Explain how you would dry up your code if you noticed that you are repeating the same logic in multiple places?

To add to my previous answer, if I notice that I am repeating the same logic in multiple places, I would try to identify any functions that serve the same purpose. For example, in the Cookie-Stand project, if I find myself calculating cookie sales in multiple sections, I would create a separate function dedicated to this calculation.

## Describe some benefits of releasing an MVP of a product.

**Benefits of releasing MVP for product**

* Allow Users to provide early Feedback.
* Launch products to user faster.
* Help risk mitigation.


## What are some potential pitfalls of waiting until a product is fully mature to release it.

**Pitfalls of waiting until a product is fully mature to release it**

* Missed market opportunities. Other competitors may launch similar producta.
* Negative feedback can hurt company reputation.


## Things I want to know more about

* just general stuff about each of these concepts. No real questions. The reading were straightforward
