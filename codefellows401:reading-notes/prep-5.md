## Code 401 - Advanced Software Development: Engineering Readings

## Overview of reading notes


These readings cover a wide range of topics related to career development in programming. They provide valuable insights into various aspects, such as improving problem-solving skills and recognizing the value of our time.


## What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?


One thing I bring to this career is my experience working in healthcare and education (teaching assistance). I feel like these two field somewhat intersect with each other, as well with programming. Thus, with my background in healthcare, I have developed strong  communication and teamworking skills that are valuable in a professional setting. Also, my experience as a Math teaching assistant has developed my problem solving skills, ability to explain complex concepts, as well as effectively support and mentor others. I feel like traits will be helpful in any professional setting.


## What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

1. Research possible solutions online, such as stackoverflow, google, chatgbt, etc
2. Debug your code. Go through step by step my code or solution to find out the issue/problem
3. Reassess. Take a step back and look at your code from another perspective. 

## Things I want to know more about

* One of the articles mentions that problem-solving skills are crucial and highly valued by employers. In a field like programming, where team collaboration is essential, which is more important; having strong problem-solving skills or effective teamwork abilities?
