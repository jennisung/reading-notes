## Overview of reading notes

These readings delve into topics such as "grit" and the "growth mindset" and highlight the importance of cultivating these mindsets for success. One common theme across these readings and videos is the significance of maintaining a positive mindset to achieve success or to have a healthier mindset. 

## Summary

These readings cover a wide range of topics, many of which delve into the importance of having the "right" mindset for success. Specifically, the videos by Carol Dweck, Angela Lee Duckworth, and Alain de Botton intersect in their exploration of mindset and perseverance. Angela Lee Duckworth's TED Talk discusses the concept of "grit" and how perseverance and passion encourage individuals to achieve their goals. By staying determined and resilient despite obstacles, individuals can attain long-term success. Carol Dweck's presentation explores the concept of the "growth mindset," which aligns with the idea of grit. Embracing setbacks and challenges as opportunities for personal growth fosters resilience and can lead to success. In Alain de Botton's video on redefining success, the importance of embracing setbacks and learning from experiences is also talked about, which also aligns with the discussions on grit and the growth mindset.

The two assessments also delve into individuals' mindsets. In the emotional self-assessment, my top scores were "self-management" with a score of 20, and "social awareness" with a score of 20. I do feel like I'm emotional intelligent and social awareness due to my previous profession. So whole it was challenging to quantify some of the questions, I believe the results are somewhat accurate. In the bias self-report assessment, my top scores were Empathy and Curiosity, and Meaningful Connections. Like the previous assessment, I can see why I got these results. My previous profession working in healthcare and education fostered these types of traits.

In conclusion, pursuing a non-traditional path in the field can often lead to personal challenges, such as having imposter syndrome. Therefore, cultivating a growth mindset, embracing setbacks, and developing resilience is essential in overcoming these obstacles and achieving success.
