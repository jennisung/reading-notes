# Reading Notes

## What is an expression in JavaScript?

An expression is a unit of code that resolves to a value.

## Assignment Operators

An assignment operator, such as equal sign (=), is used to assign a value to theleft operand, based on value to its right.

**example**

> let a = 9;

**example of a compound assignment operator**

> a += 3;
> b -= 5;

## Comparison Operator

Compares both side of a operands, and will return a logical value of the comparison is true.

**example**

> Equal (==) : return true if operands on either side is equal

> Not Equal (!=) : returns true if the operands on either side are **NOT** equal

> Strict equal (===)
> returns true if the operands are the same type and equal value
> Greater than (>)
> returns true if the left operands has a bigger value than the right

> Less than (<)
> returns true is the left operand has a smaller value than the right

## Why would we use a loop in our code?

Loops allows you to execute a block of code multiple times base on a condition.

**examples of loops**

1. 'for' loop: the loop will continue to repeat until the condition becomes false
2. 'while' loop: a while loop is used when you don't know how many times you want the code to be executed, but you do know the condition it needs to be met to stop the loop.

## When does a 'for' for loop stop executing?

In a 'for' loop, the loop will stop when the condition becomes false.

## How many times will a 'while' loop execute?

In a 'while' loop, the loop will continue to repeat as long as the condition is true.
