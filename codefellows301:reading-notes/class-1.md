## Code 301 - Intermediate Software Development: Introduction to React and Components


## Overview of reading notes

These reading materials are important as they provide an overview of components, their importance, and uses. Which will be important as we delve into react.

### What is a “component”?

A **component** is a reusable software object. Its purpose is to interact with other components and conform to the defined interface and behaviors. As a software component, it can be deployed independently and composed by third parties.

### What are the characteristics of a component?

**Key Characteristics of a Component**

1. Reusability: can be reused in different situations.
2. Replaceable: can be substituted with other components.
3. Not context specific: can operate in different contexts.
4. Extensible: can be extended from existing componenets.
5. Encapsulated: provides interface for users to access functionality, without exposing internal processes.
6. Independent: not dependent on other components.

### What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

Some advantages of using component-based architecture include ease of deployment, reusability, and reduced costs. With component-based architecture, it becomes easier to replace existing versions with new compatible ones. Components can be reused across multiple applications or systems. Lastly, incorporating third-party components can help reduce the overall costs associated with development and maintenance.


### What is “props” short for?

In react, **props** is short for *properties*.

### How are props used in React?

Props is used in react to pass data from one component to another.

### What is the flow of props?

 The flow of props is unidirectional, meaning data goes from the parent component to its child component (one-way).
