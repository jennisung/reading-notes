### What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

During the same period as the decline of women in computer science, there was an increase in the usage of personal computers in American households. This rise in personal computers also coincided with the rise of gender stereotypes of computers seen as a hobby associated mostly with boys. As a result, there was a decline in women going in fields in computer science.

### Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

This narrative perpetuating the idea that computing was a masculine field or hobby; has deterred women from getting early exposure to computers. Thus, there is a gap in early exposure to computers between men and women.

### When are diversity efforts most successful?

Diversity efforts find the most success when they are driven by a genuine commitment and push from company leaders.

### Why do diverse companies perform better?

Diverse companies perform better for several reasons: they bring a wider range of perspectives and experiences, which leads to diverse insights; diverse teams have a more skill set, allowing them to tackle a variety of issues/challenges; and they may have a better understanding of customers' needs due to their diverse teams' ability to relate to various customer needs.


### Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
