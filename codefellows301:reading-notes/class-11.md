## Code 301 - Intermediate Software Development:MongoDB and Mongoose

## Overview of reading notes

Learning about SQL and NoSQL is important because it helps developers understand the different types of database management systems.

### Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

**SQL vs NoSQL**

* SQL called as Relational Databases (RDBMS), and NoSQL called as non-relational or distributed daatabase 
* SQL databases examples; MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. Whereas, NoSQL database examples are; MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb.
* SQL databases have a predefined schema. On the other hand, NoSQL databases have a dynamic schema that allows for unstructured data.
* SQL databases are well-suited for complex query-intensive environments. In contrast, NoSQL databases may not be the ideal fit for complex queries.
* SQL databases may not be the optimal choice for hierarchical data storage. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are well-suited for hierarchical data storage


### What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

**Data is a good fit for an SQL database**

1. Data that can be represented through tables.
2. Data requiring complex querying.
3. Data not requiring hierarchical data storage.

### Give a real world example.

SQL databases examples; MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL.

### What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

1. Data that are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. 
2. Unstructured and flexible data.
3. Data that fits hierarchical data storage.


### Give a real world example.

NoSQL database examples are; MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb.

### Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL databases are well-suited for hierarchical data storage.

### Which type of database is best for scalability?

SQL databases are designed for vertical scalability. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are built for horizontal scalability.

### What does SQL stand for?

SQL stands for Structured Query Language.

### What is a relational database?

A type of database that organizes data into tables with predefined relationship between them.

### What type of structure does a relational database work with?

A relational database has tables which have rows and columns. 

### What is a ‘schema’?

Defines how data is oranized in a relational database.

### What is a NoSQL database?

Nosql is schema-less, have very few relations, data is typically merged or nested in a few collections, both horizontal/vertical scaling is possible, and it provides great performances for simple read and write requests.

### How does it work?

NoSQL databases uses key-value pairs, documents, columnar to store data. 

### What is inside of a MongoDB database?

Inside a MongoDB database, the data is stored in collections, which are similar to tabless. 

### Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

As it is a NoSQL database,  MongoDB provides greater flexibility in terms of data modeling and schema-less design, making it better fit for applications with diverse data types.

### What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

While, NoSQL databases often noted for its' scalability, scaling can be difficult and has its limits.

## Things I want to know more about

* What are the purpose of applications like; MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres, MS-SQL, MongoDB etc. Do all these applications do the same thing?
