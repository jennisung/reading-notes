## Code 301 - Intermediate Software Development: NODE.JS

## Overview of reading notes

These readings about node.js will be importants as we delve into more backend stuff in javascript. In addition, it is important to understand the importance of peer programming as we get into project phase.

### What is node.js?

Node.js is an event-based and asynchronous I/O platform that utilizes Google's V8 JavaScript engine and the libuv library.

### In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

Based on the readings, Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine is an open-source engine that helps developers enhance operating systems and file system APIs.

### What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

Runtime, when referred to in the context of using Node.js and JavaScript, means that JavaScript code can be written and executed outside of traditional environments such as web browsers or local computers.

### What is npm?

npm is a package manager that comes with Node.js to help developers install and manage packages, such as libraries, for their projects.

### What version of node are you running on your machine?

Node v20.2.0

### What version of npm are you running on your machine?

Npm 9.6.6

### What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

 npm install -g jshint

### What is node used for?

Node helps developers build high-performance applications by using javascript on the server side.

### What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

**Six reasons for pair-programming**

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social Skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

### In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

I would say environment readiness. Peer programming is different from any collaborative work I've done, and it's a big learning curve. So getting ready to be in this type of environment is helpful.

### How does pair programming work?

Peer programming works in group or pair settings. Where one person is a driver and another person is the navigator. The driver is the one typing the code and the navigator is the one who guides the other person.

## Things I want to know more about

* Since react is mostly front-end stuff and node is used for backend stuff, are these two use together alot?
