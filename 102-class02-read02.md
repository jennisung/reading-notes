# The Coder's Computer


# What are four important features to look for in a text editor?
1. **Code Completion**: the code completion feature allows users to begin typing, and this feature will display possible suggestions.
2. **Syntax highlighting**: the syntax highlighting feature colorizes the text you type to make them more noticeable. For example, attributes and elements will be in a different color.
3. **nice variation of themes**:Having a nice variation of themes is useful as it allows you to customize your text editor. For example, you can change the text color of your editor and pick a specific color scheme to reduce eye fatigue.
4. **A healthy selection of extension to choose from**: Extensions also allow you to customize your text editor, and allow you to add plugins. Adding additional functionality can help you work more efficiently.
