1. Code Completion: the code completion feature allows users to begin typing, and this feature will display possible suggestions.
2. Syntax highlighting: the syntax highlighting feature colorizes the text you type to make them more noticeable. For example, attributes and elements will be in a different color.
3. nice variation of themes:Having a nice variation of themes is useful as it allows you to customize your text editor. For example, you can change the text color of your editor and pick a specific color scheme to reduce eye fatigue.
4. A healthy selection of extension to choose from: Extensions also allow you to customize your text editor, and allow you to add plugins. Adding additional functionality can help you work more efficiently.
