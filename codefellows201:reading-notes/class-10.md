# Reading Notes


## Code 201 - Foundations of Software Development: Readings: Debugging

## Overview of reading notes:

The reading material will delve into troublehsooting and debugging our code. This is important as it'll help us write quality and cleaner code. In addition, as developers it will be crucial to understand the various errors or bugs you may encounter with your code and understand how to fix them with the tools you are given. 

### Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error. 

**Syntax errors** occur when there is some type of syntax or spelling error in your code. When there is a **syntax error** your code may not run at all or stop working partway. Some examples of **syntax errors** are missing a semicolon, a parenthesis, or brackets. While **logic errors** occur when the code does not produce the expected results you want.

### List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

Some common errors I encountered when coding:

1. Missing brackets, commas, parenthesis, or closing tag.
2. Misspelling function name or not typing out a declared variable exactly how it was written (upper case and lower case sensitivity).

### How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

Knowing about syntax errors and logic errors will be important to understand as I continue with my studies. First, it will enable me to become better at troubleshooting and debugging issues with my code. Second, it will help me identify the errors in my code and understand why I'm getting those errors. Third, it will help me become a better programmer as I'll be more conscious about writing cleaner and higher quality code.

### How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

Every modern browser is equipped with several set of developer tools. You can use these dev tools to do a wide range of things essential for coding. One of these things is debugging. Javascript debugger allows you to set breakpoints, pause code execution, and review your variables. By *setting breakpoints*, you can specify specific points in your code where you want your code execution to pause. This allows you to examine your code. *Pausing code execution* allow you to to analyze your code after it has stopped at a breakpoint. *Inspecting variables* allows you to examine the values of your variables to make sure they are correctly written.


### Define what a breakpoint is.

**Breakpoint :** a breakpoint in coding is a point in your code where you want your code execution to pause. By pausing your code execution you can inspect your code to make sure your code is correctly written or that it is being executed correctly.

### What is the call stack?

**Call stack :**  will track the execution of function execution that got to the current execution point.

## Things I want to know more about:

* is there specific debugger extension on vscode we should download to help with debugging our code?
