## Code 201 - Foundations of Software Development: Psychological Safety

## Overview of reading notes:

This reading is important as it delves into the significance and benefits of promoting psychologically safe teams. This topic is relevant to various areas in both school and work team environments, and it is important to understand the elements that contribute to creating a safe team environment.

### What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

**Three key factors for psychological safe teams:**

1. Embrace the wisdom of your teammates. Try to keep the exchanges between your teammates are warm and friendly. Conversational turn-taking.
2. Inclusive and welcome environment that allows everyone to feels safe to share ideas. Or the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.
3. Empathy and understanding between peers.

### Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.

Reading the article reminded me of my experience working in a team environment during my university job, which I would consider to have had a high degree of psychological safety. I believe that having this environment was beneficial to the overall effectiveness of the entire department. During my time at the university, I had the opportunity to work in my university's IT department. From the very moment I joined the team, I immediately felt a sense of an inclusive atmosphere that encouraged open communication and collaboration. My supervisors made it their mission to help create an environment where everyone's questions were respected. For instance, during our training period, we were encouraged to lean on our supervisors and teammates for help and guidance. We were never judged when it came to asking questions. even if we asked the same question multiple times. As a result, we fostered a strong sense of teamwork, as we knew that we could rely on one another help. This has helped immensely in keeping our morale up when we would come to work, even on days when it was busy. Our customer satisfaction was at 95% or over for the majority (if not all) months I was working there. And I think this was largely due to the safe working environment of our department.

### What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

Teams with a high degree of psychological safety allow individuals to feel more comfortable sharing ideas, asking questions, and contributing effectively to the team. Fostering this type of working environment, which encourages open communication, active listening, and empathy, helps promote collaboration, innovation, increase engagement between workers, and promote stronger unit cohesion.
