# Reading Notes

## Code 201 - Foundations of Software Development: Readings: HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout.

## Overview of reading notes:

These reading will be important it'll delve deeper into ways to layout things on your website. The reading also go over the fundamental concepts of functions. In addition, to some readings that talk about the importance of pair programming when learning to code. 

### To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

By using the < a> element you can create a basic link is created by wrapping the text or other inside this element. In addition, you will use the **href** attribute (Hypertext Reference) to add the web address you want to turn to a hyperlink. 

### The href attribute contains what information?

The **href** attribute is crucial to the < a> element as it contains the web address you want to hyperlink to go to.

### What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

It is best practices to actively try to make your code and wbepage accessible to all readers. As such, when adding links to your page you will want to do the following things:

1. Keep your link as short as possible.
2. Try not to have multiple of the same text that is linking to various different places.
3. Don't repeat the same URL in the link text.

### What is meant by “normal flow”?

**"Normal Flow"** refers to the default layout or structure of a webpage before any changes have been made using CSS. 

### What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

The contents of **Block-level** elements will adjust its size alongside the block dimension. Whereas, the size of the **Inline element** is set to the size of its' content.

### ___ positioning is the default for every html element.

Static positioning is the default for every html element.

### Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

Being able to manipulate the positioning in your page layout is a useful to help you create a layout that works for you. There is several advantages of using absolute positioning on an element:

1. When an element is absolutely positioned, it sits on own isolated layer. This is useful if you're creating UI features.
2. There is more control over placement as the position of the element is more specified.


### What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

In absolute positioning, the element is position relative to the intial containing block or the ancestor element. Whereas the fixed positioning, fixes the element in place relative to the viewpoint. Meaning that the element will stay in the same (fixed) position shown in the screen.

### Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

A **function delcaration** is when you create/define a function. Whereas a **function invocation** is when you run or execute a function. Which means that the code in the function is executed and the result is returned.

### What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

A **parameter** is a value that acts as a placeholder for in input value in a function Whereas a **argument** is the actual value that is pass through the function when it is executed or 'invoked'.

### Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

I believe "learning from fellow students" and "engaged collaboration" as two crucial benefits that will support my coding journey. Active participation and collaboration are valuable as they foster accountability and focus within the team. In addition, teamwork offers the advantage of seeking help and support from each other. The other benefit, "learning from fellow students", is also essential as it allows me to gain insights on how to approach a problem by observing and learning from others in class. By becoming more exposed to the thoughts of others and how they solve problems, I can improve as a developer.
