### Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?

In order to add some character to a colorless website or blog, it's essential to select an appropriate color scheme that matches the overall theme of the website you're trying to create. Choosing a base color that complements the website's subject matter is the first step to help you achieve this. It's crucial to pick the right color, as each color can represent a different meaning, conveying various emotions and messages. So my advice if someone needs help with improving one's website if to pick a base color color first. I would also suggest to pick a color that is easily accessible. If you want your website to be viewed by a wide audience take into account colors that may not work well with those with color-blindness.
