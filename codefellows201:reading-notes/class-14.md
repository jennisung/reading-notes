# Reading Notes


## Code 201 - Foundations of Software Development: 

## Overview of reading notes:

These readings will be important as they delve into other ways of using CSS transforms, CSS transitions, and animations to make your website more visually appealing and engaging for users.

### What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?


The CSS transform property has two settings: two-dimensional and three-dimensional. It enables developers to modify, resize, position, and manipulate elements on a web page.

### Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.

`<style>
    .question-one {
     backface-visibility: hidden;
  transform: rotateY(180deg);
  </style>`

The example shown above is an example of three-dimensional transform. This piece of code will apply a rotational effect to the class named ".question-one", rotating it by the y-axis 180 degrees. I could use this feature to make some pictures in my website more interactive.

### What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?

The CSS transition allows developers to design interactive websites by altering the appearance and behavior of elements. Specifically, when a CSS transition is added, the state of the element can be modified to apply some type of modification over a timed period.

### Four transition properties:

1. transition-property
2. transition-duration 
3. transition-timing-function 
4. transition-delay

### How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?

With CSS animation provides more control in the customizing effects with multiple keyframes. While CSS transition provides developers with the ability to apply visual interactive elements by making elements change from one state to another.

### What are some benefits to using CSS transitions on websites?

Adding various types of transition features, such as making interactive buttons, links, and more, to your website offers several benefits. It can make your website more visual appealing, increase user engagement, and increase interactivity of your website for users who visit your website.


### How this topic fit in with your long-term goals?

This topic fits into my long-term goals as an aspiring web developer or software engineer. My aim is to broaden my knowledge and gain a better understanding of how to create visually engaging and interactive features for any website or project I create in the future. Improving my skills in using tools like transform, transition, and animation, along with other techniques, will help me develop better websites that users will enjoy.


## Things I want to know more about

* Are there specific do's and don'ts when using the features we mentioned? Is there anything we should know that may affect accessibility for users using screen readers?
